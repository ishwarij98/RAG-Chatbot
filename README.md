## âœ¯âœ¨ What is RAG?

**RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique that improves the quality and relevance of AI-generated responses by combining:

-  **Generative AI (OpenAI)**: To produce natural, human-like responses.
-  **Retrieval from Vector DB (Astra DB)**: To fetch relevant documents based on user queries.

This hybrid model solves hallucination problems and enables the chatbot to answer with real, factual, and personalized information.
